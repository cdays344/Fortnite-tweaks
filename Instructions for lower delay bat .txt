This is a bloom reducer pack no i didnt create it and yes i paid for it.I just feel this shi shouldnt be gate kept especially for those who dont have money. This lowered my delay so much and made my mouse feel way better and more accurate. i would feel wrong if i was selling this but im not im giving it free.
Remember to set a restore point please!
