To ADD IOPageLockLimit to the Regestry navigate to:Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management

Then add a DWORD 32-bit vaule or QWORD 64-bit value, it really doesn't matter; I've tried it both ways

* Formula for figuring out correct setting

((Your Total Installed Memory * 1024)*1024)*128 = Memory in Bytes to set as Decimal Base, not Hexagon.

For Example: Here are my system settings

((8GB Installed memory * 1024)*1024))*128 = 1073741824 bytes or (1GB)

So I would set the IOPageLockLimit at (1073741824 as a decimal base) or (8000000 Hexagon)

You will see a huge increase in startup speed and large file transfers and over system performance. You'll also see a huge difference when running Windows Update. Big Time!
