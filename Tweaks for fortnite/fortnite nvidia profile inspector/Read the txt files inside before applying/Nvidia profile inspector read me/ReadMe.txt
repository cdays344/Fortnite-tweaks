Import the custom fortnite nip
This worked great on both my gtx 1660 and rtx 4060.
If this somehow results in worse delay or fps you have a few options.
First option would be select one of the other custom fortnite nips and test that config, do this by importing the nips in order from num 1 to num 3. 
Note that each nip is numbered by how effective it has been for me in my own personal research and i am still perfecting these nips. 
If none of these nips worked for you then select the fortnite revert folder and revert the nip.
